 <strong> <h2>  My Interests </h2> </strong> 
<h3> Harry Potter </h3>

<p> My MOST FAVORITE THING IN THE WORLD IS HARRY POTTER. Harry Potter is a series of 7 books,The Sorcerer's Stone, The Chamber of Secrets, the Prisoner of Azkaban, the Goblet of Fire, The Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince, and last but not least, The Deathly Hallows. My favorite book is the Prisoner of Azkaban because I like the story plot of his book the best. Those of you who have read Harry Potter you probably know what I'm talking about. As for you who haven't, YOU BETTER READ HARRY POTTER.
