<p> Harry Potter is a series of 7 books, 
The Sorcerer's Stone, The Chamber of Secrets, the Prisoner of Azkaban, the Goblet of Fire, the  Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince, and 
The Deathly Hallows. Personally, my favorite books are the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Goblet of Fire. And I don't like the last 2 books that much because
for me there are too many deaths and it's kind of depressing. Those of you that have read the books you'd know what I mean and those of you that haven't BETTER READ IT!!!!
<h3> Harry Potter Characters</h3>
<p> Harry Potter is a series of book, obviously, about a boy named Harry Potter, but in the book there are also two more VERY IMPORTANT people. They are Harry's best friends, Ron and Hermione.</p>
<h4> Harry Potter</h4>

<p>Harry Potter was the child of Lily Evans and James Potter. James Potter and Lily Evans were both wizards who met each other at Hogwarts School for Wards and WItches.
When Harry was young his parents were killed by Voldemort, the evil dark wizard, and he was given into custody of his Aunt from his mom's size. Her name was Petunia Dursley and she hated wizards. 
So, she never told Harry he was a wizard, and Harry never knew, until his 11th birthday. At his iith birthday he ws told he was a wizard and was brought to Hogwarts.
Once he gets to Hogwarts he meets Hermione and Ron. </p>
<h4> Ron Weasley</h4>

<p>Ron's real name is Ronald Billius Weasley, but he prefers to be called Ron. He has 6 more siblings along with his mother and father. 
He is the younger brother of Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred,George, and the older brother of Ginny. He as well as Harry was sorted into Gryfindoor(A house in Hogwarts).
Ron is very scared of spiders, but later in the books he has to go to a place full of spiders and face his fear. Ron is very close to his family, 
though sometimes he is ashamed becuase of their lack of money. He usually gets his older brothers' items and gets annoyed. Ron was funny, but at times he was also immature and emotionally insensitive. One time Hermione commented that he had the , " Emotional range of a teaspoon." 
</p>
<h4> Hermione Granger</h4>

<p> Hermione Granger, personally is my FAVORITE CHARACATER. She is the smartest witch in Hogwarts and extremely clever. She is a Muggle-born, meaning that she was born to two non-wizard parents.
She is always at the top of the class because she is extremely hard-working and intelligent. Because of this though, many people tease her for being a bookworm and a muggle-born. 
She was responsible, organized, and a perfectionist which later led to her being a prefect. Despite her confidence in her abilities, she was never arrogant and she helped her classmates
whenever she could. Hermione was extremely loyal to her friends and risked her life many times for them.
